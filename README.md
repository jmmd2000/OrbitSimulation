# OrbitSimulation
The final project for CS171 (Computer Systems 1) in the 1st year of the course was to basically show off what we had learned. This module had us using Processing and we were able to do whatever we wanted. I decided to recreate an amazing gif I had seen online of two planets orbitting the Sun and making a flower pattern. Not only did I manage to recreate the gif near perfectly but I also added a layer of interactivity where the user was able to place their own planets and see what pattern was traced. Below is the exact gif I based the project on.
